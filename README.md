# Frontend Mentor - Fylo landing page with two column layout

## This is my response to the challenge

## As of this challenge, code quality was not under consideration

## Lessons Learnt:
- Qualitative work over quantitative
- How to search when you are stuck
- More opportunity to practice on Positioning, Placing, Sizing and use of mixins 
- Better keep the "a" tag as innermost as possible
- We do not give any vertical alignment on "span" tags

## Need to focus on
- Code Quality
- DRY practices
- Accebility issues
- ARIA mdn implementation in HTML
- Do something about the social links in footer, they always create a problem
  - Their border ring , currently I do it by bordering them by bordering the a tag and then adjusting the padding accordingly as per each icon
  - And if i place the "a" tag inside the "i" tag then I am unable to give it the ring
  - Either learn to edit those SVGs or find a generic way to tackle all the icons at once
